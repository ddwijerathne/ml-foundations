# NumPy – Arrays and Data Types

## Overview

This module is part of my **Machine Learning Foundations** preparation for **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**.

The notebook in this folder focuses on understanding **NumPy arrays**, their **data types (dtype)**, and why dtype selection is important for performance and memory efficiency in machine learning workflows.
