# NumPy – Foundations for Machine Learning

## Overview

This module is part of my **Machine Learning Foundations** preparation.

The notebooks in this folder focus on building a strong understanding of **NumPy**, which is a core library for numerical computing and Machine Learning in Python. Each notebook is designed to cover one fundamental concept in a clear, incremental manner.

## Contents

### 📘 `01_arrays_and_dtypes.ipynb`
This notebook covers:
- Creating NumPy arrays
- Automatic vs explicit data type assignment
- Inspecting array `dtype`
- Memory usage differences between data types
- Why dtype selection matters in ML pipelines

---

### 📘 `02_indexing_and_slicing.ipynb`
This notebook covers:
- Indexing 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
- Slicing techniques
- Accessing rows, columns, and sub-arrays
- Common indexing patterns used in data preprocessing
- How improper indexing can lead to logical bugs

---

### 📘 `03_vectorization_vs_loops.ipynb`
This notebook covers:
- Performance comparison between Python loops and NumPy vectorization
- Why vectorized operations are significantly faster
- Readability and maintainability benefits of vectorized code
- Practical implications for Machine Learning workloads

---

### 📘 `04_broadcasting_and_shapes.ipynb`
This notebook covers:
- Understanding array shapes and dimensions
- NumPy broadcasting rules
- Broadcasting with scalars, vectors, and matrices
- Common broadcasting errors and how to fix them
- Real-world Machine Learning use cases (bias addition, normalization)

---

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, I am able to:
- Create and manipulate NumPy arrays confidently
- Apply correct indexing and slicing techniques
- Write efficient numerical code using vectorization
- Understand and apply broadcasting rules correctly
- Reason about performance, memory usage, and shape alignment in ML pipelines

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes

- Notebook outputs are intentionally kept minimal to ensure GitHub rendering compatibility.
- Each notebook focuses on a single concept to maintain clarity and readability.
- This work is part of a structured, incremental learning plan with publicly verifiable progress.
